            <h2>Why I Created Endless Dungeons</h2>
            <div class="post-date">February 14, 2026</div>
            <p>Welcome to the first post in the Endless Dungeons development log! I wanted to take a moment to share why this game exists and what inspired me to create it.</p>
            
            <p>A few years ago, I discovered a card game called Scoundrel. It was simple, elegant, and surprisingly strategic for something played with a standard deck of cards. I found myself coming back to it again and again, but I noticed that not everyone had access to it, and I wanted to share that experience with others.</p>
            
            <p>That's when I decided to create Endless Dungeons—a web-based version that anyone could play, anywhere, on any device. But as I started building, I realized I didn't just want to recreate Scoundrel; I wanted to evolve it. I added new mechanics like the sword system for permanent power-ups, shield durability that adds a risk-reward element to every fight, and a scoring system that encourages strategic play rather than just survival.</p>
            
            <p>The development process has been a journey of iteration and learning. Every feature I've added has been tested, refined, and sometimes completely reimagined. The game has grown from a simple prototype into something I'm genuinely proud of—a strategic dungeon crawler that's easy to pick up but challenging to master.</p>
            
            <p>This updates page will serve as a chronicle of that journey. I'll be sharing development updates, new features as they're added, and insights into the design decisions that shape the game. Whether you're a player curious about what's coming next or just interested in game development, I hope you'll find something interesting here.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for playing Endless Dungeons. Your support and feedback have been invaluable in making this game what it is today.</p>
