        <h3>Card Types:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Monsters: All spades and clubs.</li>
            <li>Weapons: All diamonds. Grow weaker with each use and persist until replaced.</li>
            <li>Potions: All hearts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Hearts and diamonds face cards (J, Q, K) are not used in this variant.</p>
        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You start with 20 health.</li>
            <li>Draw cards to fill your hand (up to 4 cards), which is the room containing monsters.</li>
            <li>Play weapons to equip them in the weapons area.</li>
            <li>Select Bare Hands Attack or Weapon Attack to highlight the method.</li>
            <li>Click on a monster card to attack it with the selected method.</li>
            <li>For weapon attacks: Weapons weaken by 1 after each use. If the weapon is weaker than the monster and hasn't been trained yet, take damage equal to the difference and weaken the weapon. After training, the weapon cannot fight stronger monsters.</li>
            <li>Flee from a monster, taking its damage. You can only flee once in a row.</li>
            <li>Potions heal you.</li>
            <li>Defeated monsters and used potions go to the discard pile. Used weapons are discarded only when replaced.</li>
            <li>Goal: Clear all monsters from the room without dying.</li>
        </ul>
